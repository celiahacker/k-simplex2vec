# k-simplex2vec

We present a novel method of associating Euclidean features to simplicial complexes, providing a way to use them as input to statistical and machine learning tools. This method extends the node2vec algorithm to simplices of higher dimensions, providing insight into the structure of a simplicial complex, or into the higher-order interactions in a graph.
